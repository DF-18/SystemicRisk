Some of the aforementioned models have been improved or extended according to the methodologies described in the [V-Lab Documentation](https://vlab.stern.nyu.edu/docs), which represents a great source of systemic risk measurement.

The project has been published in `"MATLAB Digest | Financial Services | May 2019"`.

## Requirements

The minimum required `MATLAB` version is `R2014b`. In addition, the following products and toolboxes must be installed in order to properly execute the script:

* Computer Vision System Toolbox
* Curve Fitting Toolbox
* Econometrics Toolbox
* Financial Toolbox
* Image Processing Toolbox
* Optimization Toolbox
* Parallel Computing Toolbox
* Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
* System Identification Toolbox

## Usage

1. Create a properly structured database (see the section below).
1. Execute one of the following scripts (they can be edited following your needs and criteria):
   * `run.m` to perform the computation of systemic risk measures;
   * `analyze.m` to analyze previously computed systemic risk measures.

## Dataset

Datasets must be built following the structure of default ones included in every release of the framework (see `Datasets` folder). Below a list of the supported Excel sheets and their respective content:

* **Shares:** prices or returns expressed in logarithmic scale of the benchmark index (the column can be labeled with any desired name and must be placed just after observation dates) and the firms, with daily frequency.
* **Volumes:** trading volume of the firms expressed in currency amount, with daily frequency.
* **Capitalizations:** market capitalization of the firms, with daily frequency.
* **CDS:** the risk-free rate expressed in decimals (the column must be called `RF` and must be placed just after observation dates) and the credit default swap spreads of the firms expressed in basis points, with daily frequency.
* **Balance Sheet Components:** the balance sheet components of the firms expressed in omogeneous observations frequency, currency and scale, structured as below:
  * **Assets:** the book value of assets.
  * **Equity:** the book value of equity.
  * **Separate Accounts:** the separate accounts of insurance firms.
* **State Variables:** systemic state variables, with daily frequency.
* **Groups:** group definitions are based on three-value tuples where the `Name` field represents the group names, the `Short Name` field represents the group acronyms and the `Count` field represents the number of firms to include in the group. The sum of the `Count` fields must be equal to the number of firms. For example, the following groups definition:

  > Firms in the Shares Sheet: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H  
  > Insurance Companies: 2  
  > Investment Banks: 2  
  > Commercial Banks: 3  
  > Government-sponsored Enterprises: 1

  produces the following outcome:

  > "Insurance Companies" contains A and B  
  > "Investment Banks" contains C and D  
  > "Commercial Banks" contains E, F and G  
  > "Government-sponsored Enterprises" contains H

* **Crises:** crises can be defined using two different approaches:
  * *By Events:* based on two-value tuples where the `Date` field represents the event dates and the `Name` field represents the event names; every dataset observation matching an event date is considered to be associated to a distress occurrence.
  * *By Ranges:* based on three-value tuples where the `Name` field represents the crisis names, the `Start Date` field represents the crisis start dates and the `End Date` field represents the crisis end dates; every dataset observation falling inside a crisis range is considered to be part of a distress period.

#### Notes

* The minimum allowed dataset must include the `Shares` sheet with a benchmark index and at least `3` firms. Observations must have a daily frequency and, in order to run consistent calculations, their minimum required amount is `253` for prices (which translates into a full business year plus an additional observation at the beginning of the time series, lost during the computation of returns) or `252` for logarithmic returns. They must have been previously validated and preprocessed by:
  * discarding illiquid series (unless necessary);
  * detecting and removing outliers;
  * removing rows with NaNs or filling the gaps through interpolation.

* It is not mandatory to include financial time series used by unwanted measures. Optional financial time series used by included measures can be omitted, as long as their contribution isn't necessary. Below a list of required and optional time series for each category of measures:

  * **Component Measures:**
    * *Required:* shares (any).
    * *Optional:* none.
  * **Connectedness Measures:**
    * *Required:* shares (any).
    * *Optional:* groups.
  * **Cross-Entropy Measures:**
    * *Required:* shares (any), cds.
    * *Optional:* capitalizations, balance sheet, groups.
  * **Cross-Quantilogram Measures:**
    * *Required:* shares (any).
    * *Optional:* state variables.
  * **Cross-Sectional Measures:**
    * *Required:* shares (any), capitalizations, balance sheet.
    * *Optional:* separate accounts, state variables.
  * **Default Measures:**
    * *Required:* shares (any), capitalizations, cds, balance sheet.
    * *Optional:* none.
  * **Liquidity Measures:**
    * *Required:* shares (prices), volumes, capitalizations.
    * *Optional:* state variables.
  * **Regime-Switching Measures:**
    * *Required:* shares (any).
    * *Optional:* none.
  * **Spillover Measures:**
    * *Required:* shares (any).
    * *Optional:* none.
  
* Firms whose time series value is constantly equal to `0` in the tail, for a span that includes a customizable percentage of total observations (by default `5%`), are considered to be `defaulted`. Firms whose `Equity` value is constantly negative in the tail, for a span that includes a customizable percentage of total observations (by default `5%`), are considered to be `insolvent`. This allows the scripts to exclude them from computations starting from a certain point in time onward; defaulted firms are excluded by all the measures, insolvent firms are excluded only by `SCCA` default measures.

* Once a dataset has been parsed, the script stores its output in the form of a `.mat` file; therefore, the parsing process is executed only during the first run. The file last modification date is taken into account by the script and the dataset is parsed once again if the `Excel` spreadsheet is modified.

* Depending on `OS` (version, bitness, regional settings), `Excel` (version, bitness, regional settings) and/or `MATLAB`, the dataset parsing process might present issues. Due to the high number of users asking for help, **support is no more guaranteed**; the guidelines below can help solving the majority of problems:
  * A bitness mismatch between the `OS` and `Excel` may cause errors that are extremely difficult to detect. Using the same bitness for both is recommended.
  * An `Excel` locale other than `English` may produce wrong outputs related to date formats, string labels and numerical values with decimals and/or thousands separators. A locale switch is recommended.
  * Both `Excel 2019` and `Excel 365` may present compatibility issues with `MATLAB` versions prior to `R2019b`. In later versions, the built-in function `readtable` may still not handle some `Excel` spreadsheets properly. A downgrade to `Excel 2016` is recommended.
  * If the  dataset parsing process is too slow, the best way to speed it up is to provide a standard `Excel` spreadsheet (`.xlsx`) with no filters and styles, or a binary `Excel` spreadsheet (`.xlsb`).
  * The  dataset parsing process takes place inside the `ScriptsDataset\parse_dataset.m` function. Error messages thrown by the aforementioned function are pretty straightforward and a debugging session should be enough to find the underlying causes and fix datasets and/or internal functions accordingly. 99.9% of the effort has already been made here, undertaking the remaining 0.01% should not be dramatic.

* Some scripts may take very long time to finish in presence of huge datasets and/or extreme parametrizations. The performance of calculations may vary depending on the CPU processing speed and the number of CPU cores available for parallel computing.
